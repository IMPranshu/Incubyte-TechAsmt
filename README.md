## Introduction
This repository contains the working solution of the problem statement asked. A data pipeline needs to be constructed for the given assignment and the wroking of it has been explained in detail below.

## General Concepts
* [SQL DataBases](https://www.oracle.com/in/database/what-is-database/#:~:text=A%20database%20is%20an%20organized,database%20management%20system%20(DBMS).&text=The%20data%20can%20then%20be,updated%2C%20controlled%2C%20and%20organized.)

* [Data Pipelining](https://hazelcast.com/glossary/data-pipeline/)
* [ETL](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Extract,_transform,_load)
* [Python module-pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)
* [MySQL Connector](https://www.mysql.com/products/connector/)

## Technologies Used
* [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/)
* [MySQL Workbech](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)
* [XAMPP Server](https://www.apachefriends.org/blog/news-article-61070.html)
* [Vistual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


## Initial Setup
* XAMPP server is setup and run in background.
* A sample database is created as per the schema given in the problem statement docs.
* Then the nesessary python modules are imported for connecting MySQL and Python.
* A python script is implemeted in place to connect with the Database.
* The data is reterived and python module - pandas dataframe is used for table manipulation.

## Sample 




The working of data pipeline is demonstarted using tools listed below. Also, a dummy database has been created to demonstarte a simple data flow in different formats from server to the local system, using country-based row filteration.
